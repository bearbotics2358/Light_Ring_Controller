  created 3/29/14 BD from main.c in AVR312, sort of
	- bugs in AVR312
Switched to cyz baseline for TWI routines

created ~2/10/15 from i2C_rgb
- added code for neo-pixels
- it works! except 1 led (last written?) is right color, but very bright
test used green with a value of 15
updated 2/11/15
- tried with 15 instead of 16 - the one next to the blank is very bright
- tried with 17, looks similar (same?) to original
- took out pulsing BLUE pin in old rgb led code, cause that's the pin
being used for neo-pixel
- #if'd out old code for led
- same issue
- added code to set from I2C
Acks ok
Now no bright led (still at NUM_PIXELS=17)
But doesn't change with I2C commands
- put rgb led code (minus BLUE) back in, so have both
rgb Green led flashing, as if rebooting
On a positive note, no bright neopixel
- took out sending neo pixels in loop
- set NUM_PIXELS to 16
- Now controllable, get acks, rgb led ok
Neo-pixels have bright green led again
- ASSUMPTION: setting neo-pixels interferes with TWI and causes reset
- Set neo-pixels only after it has received all 3 bytes
still appears to reset constantly
- change "index" to "val_index" to make compiler happy
- set val_index to 0 before calling usiTwiSlaveInit()
- make the state variable overflowState from TWI global and add displayed
When a byte is received, clear displayed
Check if it has been displayed and between messages, then send
Works! but have to send it twice
And no bright pixel!
- switch to using twi_stopped, which should tell when between messages
never updated pixel ring
- Switch back to val_index and !displayed
Bright pixel at boot
It Works!!!

NOTE: don't forget to clean up changes to twi, get rid of twi_stopped, ...

updated 2/12/15
- move neo-pixel init to before enabling interrupts to see if it fixes bright led
- change startup to be Bears colors - alternating blue and white:
blue: 0 0 20
white: 15 15 15
- interesting, one led is still bright green, but otherwise ok
- even with adding a 500ms delay after sending pixels, still get bright green led

/*! \mainpage
 * \section Intro Introduction
 * This documents data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs in the software for application note AVR312.
 *
 * \section CI Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the IAR Embedded Workbench 4.11A.
 *
 * To make project:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Add the file main.c and USI_TWI_Slave to project.
 * <li> Under processor configuration, select any AVR device with USI module.
 * <li> Enable bit definitions in I/O include files
 * <li> High optimization on size is recommended for lower code size.
 * </ol>
 *
 * \section DI Device Info
 * The included source code is written for all devices with with a USI module.
 *
 * \section TS Target setup
 * This example is made to work together with the AVR310 USI TWI Master application note. In adition to connecting the TWI
 * pins, also connect PORTB to the LEDS. The code reads a message as a TWI slave and acts according to if it is a
 * general call, or an address call. If it is an address call, then the first byte is considered a command byte and
 * it then responds differently according to the commands.
